I got into tattooing about 4 years ago. I consider it a really special form of art due to the connection between the artist and the client and the amazing level of trust that comes with it. My favorite style is blackwork and all other styles closely related to it. It's mainly a mix of linework, whipshading and dotwork. With each piece, I aspire to create something unique and I always try to do my best. Every tattoo is a unique experience for me. I love my work!"}}}}
